Blockd
=============
A simple distributed lock server in Node.js

What is It?
-------------
Need to coordinate resources between multiple applications, but instances running on different servers? Don't like complicated APIs? Have a more than passing affinity for Dolph Lundgren?

Blockd allows multiple clients to acquire and release "locks", just simple string identifiers, using a simple asynchronous API. It supports variable timeout and reader-writer locking, plus the ability to immediately 

Blockd was created by Flex Rental Solutions to manage real-time availability of documents in our system across multiple instances of a Java app. We needed a simple solution.

Why Node?
-------------
When tracking through SQL and memcache didn't work, we turned to Node.Js. Its simple TCP support made it easy to prototype. The single-threaded event loop model meant blockd could forego using locks internally.

A Simple Example
-------------
To run blockd, install Node, open a command-line, navigate to the blockd directory, and run the following command:

```
node blockd.js
```

This will start the blockd node. It will echo its port back, by default 8000.

Open up a new command-line window and use netcat to connect to the server and start an interactive TCP session:

```
nc localhost 8000
```

The node server will respond and you've started a new session. To double-check commands are registering, try asking for some wisdowm:

```
wisdom
```

You will be immediately granted enlightenment. Next, you'll probably want to try acquiring a lock:

```
lock HelloWorld
```

The server should echo back the lock being acquired. If you want to see the current status, send the show command:

```
show
```
You will receive a list of currently acquired locks on the server. To release the lock, try the release command:

```
release HelloWorld
```

That will let go of the lock. You can verify with another lock command.

Notes
-------------
Here are some special details about the behavior of the system:

* Commands are NOT case-sensitive; however, lock identifiers are case-sensitive. That means "HelloWorld" is a different lock than "helloworld".
